\section{Introduction}
Convolution is a fundamental building block for many application tasks, including image and video processing and machine learning models.
Convolution can be performed on multiple dimensions, but 2D, depth-wise and multi-channel 2D convolutions are among the most frequently used application
scenarios. Specifically, 2D convolution is often used in image filtering, frame
interpolation~\cite{Perrot2014Fine,Ma2014Optimized,Rudi2015Image,Niklaus2017Video},  the multi-channel 2D convolution is at the core of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
\cite{Krizhevsky2012ImageNet,SimonyanZ14a,HeZRS16,SzegedyLJSRAEVR15} and the depth-wise convolution is the building block of many embedded CNNs
\cite{Sandler_2018_CVPR,Ma_2018_ECCV,tan2019efficientnet}. However, convolution operations are computation and memory intensive
\cite{cavigelli2015accelerating}, and account for nearly 90\% of the overall runtime \cite{Li2016Performance} for representative image and
machine learning processing tasks. Therefore, there is a critical need for accelerating convolution operations.



A wide range of techniques have been proposed to accelerate convolution operations
\cite{Iandola2014Communication,vasilache2014fast,lavin2016fast,cho2017mec,Zhen2018Optimizing,Vasudevan2017Parallel,Chellapilla2006High,zhang2015dwarfcode}.
Among these methods, general matrix multiplication (GEMM) \cite{Vasudevan2017Parallel,Chellapilla2006High}, fast fourier transform (FFT)
\cite{vasilache2014fast} and winograd \cite{lavin2016fast} methods are the broadly adopted ones;  all of which follow a three-step
processing pipeline. The algorithms first transform the input and a filter (which is applied on the input) into two matrices. Then, fast
matrix multiplication algorithms \cite{karstadt2017matrix,scott2015matrix} are performed on the two matrices before finally converting the
result into the output. However, this processing pipeline can incur many GPU global memory transactions (or
memory accesses) during the transformation phase due to the involvement of matrix multiplications and duplicate elements of the transformed
matrices. Unfortunately, GPU global memory accessing is typically expensive. For example, on an NVIDIA GPU, the global memory accessing
latency is 16.7x longer than that of the shared memory. As a result, the large number of global memory transactions introduced by
convolution operations lead to longer processing time and could become the bottleneck for both model training and inferencing.  This
phenomenon is a serious problem for the commonly used distributed memory architecture on high-end GPUs, where memory access is often
responsible for the whole-system performance bottleneck. Therefore, prior optimization techniques leave a large room for improvement when
executing convolution operations on GPUs.


This study aims to optimize the memory performance involved when executing convolution operations on GPUs. To this end, we introduce two novel optimization techniques
for operations performed on columns and rows. The first technique exploits column reuse by utilizing shuffle instructions (supported by
both CUDA and OpenCL and hence is applicable to mainstream GPUs) to exchange elements among threads within the same GPU warp (or working
group). In this way, we can avoid reloading the same elements shared among different threads. We further extend the shuffle instructions to
facilitate dynamic indexing, which is not supported in the previous study \cite{vasilache2014fast}. The second technique targets row reuse
by multiplying one input row with multiple rows of a convolutional kernel (or filter) to compute multiple output elements. This strategy
improves the data locality of elements within a row, reducing the number of memory transactions compared with that of the
existing convolution processing pipeline. By reducing the number of memory transactions, our approach thus can improve the performance for
convolution operations.

We apply our optimization techniques to 2D,  depth-wise and multi-channel 2D convolution operations and evaluate them on an NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU. We compare
our approach against a range of highly optimized  deep neural network (DNN) libraries, including cuDNN \cite{ChetlurWVCTCS14}. Experimental
results show that our approach delivers over 4$\times$ faster performance over the best-performing competitive strategy.

This paper makes the following technical contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It presents a novel algorithm for column reuse (Section~\ref{sec:creuse}), which has a better generalization
      ability over prior work.
  \item It presents a novel row reuse algorithm to improve the data locality and reduce the number of global memory transactions when
      performing convolution in the row direction (Section~\ref {sec:rowreuse}).
  \item It describes a novel method for transforming dynamic indices into static indices. Our approach enhances register promotion,
      leading to better performance (Section \ref{exp}).
\end{itemize}
