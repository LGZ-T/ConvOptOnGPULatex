We now demonstrate how our column and row reuse optimizations can be used together to optimize GPU memory transactions for convolution
operations. We take the widely used 2D convolution as an example to illustrate how to apply proposed reuse algorithms on convolution
operations.


To apply our approach to 2D convolution, we first divide the output into sub-blocks. Each sub-block contains exactly $n$ columns (in this
work, $n = 32$, which is the default warp size of our GPU platform). The only exception is the last sub-block, which may contain less than
$n$ columns. If a sub-block contains more than $k$ rows ($k=56$ in this work), we then further breakdown the sub-block along the hight
dimension. By doing so, each GPU thread block will process one or multiple sub-blocks, and each warp will compute one sub-block. As a
result, the threads within the same warp will process the adjacent columns of one sub-block.

Figure \ref{fig:overalldesign} shows the mapping process of GPU threads to output elements. In this example, we slide a $3 \times 3$ filter
over an $8 \times 8$ input.  Given that 2D convolutions typically produce an output image that has the same size as the input image, the
input image should be padded. To reduce the memory pressure, we do not actually allocate GPU memory space for the padded elements. Instead,
we use different methods to calculate the edge and inner elements of the output. The edge and inner elements are represented by the shaded
and dashed squares in Figure \ref{fig:overalldesign}, respectively.Figure \ref{fig:overalldesign} shows the mapping process of the threads
onto output elements. Given that 2D convolutions normally produce an output image that has the same size as the input image, the latter
should be padded. But we do not actually allocate memory on the GPU. We use different methods to calculate the edge and inner elements of
the output. The edge and inner elements are represented by the shaded and dashed squares in Figure \ref{fig:overalldesign}, respectively.


In this example, we assume each warp contain four threads (Figure \ref{fig:overalldesign}). Therefore, we will divide the inner elements
into multiple sub-blocks â€“ each sub-block contains four columns so that a column can be processed by one of the four GPU threads within a
wrap. In our case, we will have two sub-blocks, where sub-block 0 contains four columns, but sub-block 1 only contains two columns. To
utilize the threads within a warp, we divide elements of the last two columns evenly among the four threads.

\mypara{Generalization.} In Algorithm \ref{algo:overalldesign}, we describe our generalized solution. Here, we process the sub-blocks with
exactly 32 columns (i.e., the default wrap size of our evaluation GPU) and the last sub-block in Lines 4-15 and 16-19, respectively. In
this way, each GPU thread calculates one column of the output elements. This is done through a number of steps. First, each thread block
loads the filter into shared memory and divides the filter into a combination of 3-column and 5-column sub-filters. Next, each thread
calculates the address of the first input element it needs (Lines 9). For each output element and sub-filter, each thread loads
corresponding input elements into $iTemp$ and passes it to Algorithms \ref{algo:basic} and \ref{algo:basic2} to fill the row vector $iTemp$
(Line 10). Then, each thread passes the filled vector $iTemp$ to Algorithm \ref{algo:rowreuse} to calculate multiple output elements and
store results in register array $sum$ (Line 11). Finally, when the calculation of one output element is completed, we write the
corresponding result in $sum$ into the result array $O$ (Line 13).
